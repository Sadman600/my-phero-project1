            <p>In software engineering, a software development process is the process of dividing software development
                work into smaller, parallel or sequential steps or subprocesses to improve design, product management.
                It is also known as a software development life cycle (SDLC). The methodology may include the
                pre-definition of specific deliverables and artifacts that are created and completed by a project team
                to develop or maintain an application.</p>

            </div>
            <p>Known as the 'software development life cycle,' these six steps include planning, analysis, design,
                development & implementation, testing & deployment and maintenance. Let's study each of these steps to
                know how the perfect software is developed.
                Most modern development processes can be vaguely described as agile. Other methodologies include
                waterfall, prototyping, iterative and incremental development, spiral development, rapid application
                development, and extreme programming.
                A life-cycle "model" is sometimes considered a more general term for a category of methodologies and a
                software development "process" a more specific term to refer to a specific process chosen by a specific
                organization.[citation needed] For example, there are many specific software development processes that
                fit the spiral life-cycle model. The field is often considered a subset of the systems development life
                cycle. </p>

            <p>In order to distribute the COVID-19 vaccine among the people of Bangladesh, the ICT Division of
                Bangladesh has come up with a web portal and mobile application to proceed with the initial registration
                process. Surokkha is providing the facility to register for vaccination for the people of Bangladesh.
                If anyone wants to register for the COVID-19 vaccine, they must provide the National Identification
                number or Birth certificate number to verify. The following information is being verified from this
                application.
                - National Identification Number/Birth Registration Certificate number
                - Date of Birth
                - Mobile Phone number
                - Desired Address for Vaccination Center
                - User consent for receiving vaccine

                The application verifies the user by sending an OTP to the given mobile phone number and allow them to
                register. Registrants can check their application status, download the vaccine card, and download the
                certificate.
